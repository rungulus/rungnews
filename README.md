# rungusNews
an open source news aggregator using RSS feeds
## what we need to do

 - Collate news articles from sources around the web
		 - npr
		 - nyt(?)
		 - wash. post.
		 - bbc
		 - AP
		 - cbs news
 - use these sources to find the most "interesting" stories, and elevate them
		 - maybe use ones that are posted most?
 - responsive design for all screen sizes
 - easily modifiable, users can clone and replace their news sources

## how this will run

 - serverless, all of the collation and curation will occur using user's browser 
 - as close to "raw" code as you can get, minimize library usage

## for what purpose

 - seems fun i guess
